# Sprint

This file contains reviews of all the sprints conducted through the project. Sprints are based on 
sprints used in the Scrum process. The first sprints will in the start be planned towards the different
checkpoints that are planned by the lecturer. As the project progresses there will be more frequently sprints.
After the easter break it will be scheduled sprints that last one week and maximum 2.

## Sprint 1 / Checkpoint C 2

The plan for this sprint is to experiment with the new concepts we are learning in the web technology subject as well as
doing exercises for both the application development and web technology course. Our goal is that the project progression
will match the checkpoint pipeline given by the lecturer. This we will achieve by attending lectures and plan work 
sessions.

This sprint started in week 5 and ended in week 8. The main focus of this sprint was to establish the fundamentals in 
the project. We dedicated quite some time in designing the wireframe. We also made E/R diagram and a use case diagram. 
The first thing we did after the first checkpoint was to make a repository in GitHub. In the repository we created a 
html file where we coded the html skeleton for the project. We also worked a bit on the server side, but mainly just 
exercises to get to know how the server works. 

What went good?
The tasks for this sprint were well distributed. There was no problem in attendance when sessions were scheduled. Sander 
had the main responsibility of designing the wireframe and the diagrams, but Daniel and Sten played a role in this too. 
Sten made the HTML skeleton and coded a bit in CSS, HTML and javascript to resemble the wireframe we made. Daniel made 
the git repository and had main responsibility for the sprint report.  

What went bad?/ What can be improved? 
The start of this sprint started with the extreme weather Ingunn, the thursday lectures were canceled. In this week we
didn't really do anything that lead to progression. Moving forward if there is something that comes up we should 
consider to have online meetings. However, the majority of the sessions we prefer to be physical. In this sprint only 
Sander made issues in the GitHub repository. The other group members need to make issues as well, to better keep 
track of what needs to be done.

## Sprint 2 / Checkpoint 3

The plan for this sprint Week 8 - Week 12 :
The plan for this sprint is firstly to work according to the feedback given by the lecturers in checkpoint C2. Some 
adjustments in the wireframe, database sketch and the use case diagram (more detailed described in issues). In the end
of this sprint we want to have a closely finished wireframe for computer display. In addition to this we need to create 
sketches of responsive sites (sketches for mobile phones tablets etc). We will also work towards having a static site 
with design in place. We will focus on getting a more descriptive and more concise design.md file. It is important to
set aside time so that the design guidelines for the web is followed.

To achieve what we want for this upcoming sprint we will need to look at the previous sprint. We will continue with what
went good and adjust according to what didn't. To develop our web and application skills we will as a group work on the
weekly exercises in both subjects. A crucial part of learning is by doing. In this upcoming sprint there will be 
scheduled at least one physical work session per week.    

Sprint review:
The tasks for this sprint was completed. We managed to create a website which were pretty identical to the wireframe 
sketch, and we are satisfied with this sprint progress. We created three separate html files one for the main page, one
for the different hotel options and one with detailed information about one specific hotel. By doing so each member of 
the group could participate in the designing and get the necessary learning. A sketch for a mobile version was also 
created. We also did some improvements on the database sketch and the user diagram. However, this needs to be further  
improved before we do more on the backend part of the project. 

What went good?
In this sprint we made better use of the issues. We also distributed the task in a way that every member knew what they
were supposed to do. We split up so Daniel worked on the main page of the website, which Sten worked quite a bit on last
sprint. Sander worked on hotel offer site and sten worked on the hotel description site. We had weekly sessions were we
discussed the work going forward and informed each other about changes made. 

What went bad? / What can be improved?
There are a lot of similar elements on each of the three html sites and css files. So now the frontend folder has some 
duplicated code. This is a thing that needs to be improved up on. For the next sprint we need to define a css file that 
will contain the elements that are the same on all html files. The website looked weird on larger screens so this issue
we need to address. A max width and leave white space is a common practice on booking sites. That option should be 
considered.

## Sprint 3.5 

The plan for this sprint Week 12 - April 14
The plan for this sprint is to refactor the code a bit . The issue regarding code duplication is being addressed in 
this sprint. There is also some design choices on the hotel page that need so be decided on and implemented in code. 
We have decided to use React JS frontend and spring boot rest api. So in this sprint we need to focus on learning and 
testing out react. We also need to figure out how the design should be implemented on smaller and bigger screens. 
We need to focus more on the backend. Until now the focus have almost been 100% on the frontend, now we need to have
a more 50/50 focus on the two ends. For now, it is hard to know exactly what needs to be done at the backend, but this 
will come as descriptive issues in our GitHub repository as we work on it.

To achieve what we want for this upcoming sprint we will split up the tasks in well-defined issues. We will also have 
more weekly meetings. One of the meetings or study session should be on school. We should also consider having short
discord meetings where we can decide on the things we work on separately. Another way of achieving the sprint goals is
to take more use of our lecturers and asking questions in the lecture/lecture breaks.  

Sprint review:
In this sprint we faced som difficulties. The transformation to react was a bit more challenging than expected. It went
quite some time figuring out how we should do things. The application didn't work because of some react specific syntax
and that was hard to get hang on. We managed to transform our project to a React project in the end. We didn't add new
functionality to the existing project we just made it look how it was before the transformation. Also some lack of 
communication lead to som unnecessary difficulties. 

What went good? 
In this sprint each group member dedicated more time to work on the project. We met and worked on our project several 
times. We managed to solve the problems we were faced and didn't lose motivation because of the difficulties. The first
transformation of the project were mostly done by Sten and Daniel, the reuse of footer and header. When the 
transformation first started we hadn't learned about routing and that was later worked quite bit on by Sander. On the 
end of the sprint Sander also implemented the tailwind css for the styling of the pages. This will be used for the final
project.

What went bad / What can be improved?
In this sprint there were a lot of choices to be made. The communication between the group members wasn't always the 
best. We faced some merge conflicts that could have easily been avoided with better communication. We also didn't do
much at the backend side of the application, which was planned in the sprint. The group tend to go silent when we don't 
know what to do. We need to communicate and share our thoughts with each other when we hit a speed bump in the work 
flow. Daniel dedicated quite some time in the documentation part of the project with issues and such. In the upcoming 
work other members needs to be more involved.

## Sprint 4

The plan for this sprint april 16th-25th
This wil be the last sprint meeting with the lecturers. Each group member have a responsibility to dedicate a lot of 
time to work on the project. Every other day we will work together on the project, and we will fill each other in on 
what we have done individually. The issues regarding styling the hotel-page and making decisions for different screens 
is still relevant since it wasn't completed in the last sprint. We need to establish a communication between the front 
and the backend. Images and text descriptions should be loaded from the backend and not hard coded in the jsx files.

To achieve what we want for this upcoming sprint it is important that every group member starts to use the issues 
properly. It is easier to keep track of what needs to be done if issues are made along the way. It is important
that we remind each other to create these issues. In this sprint a lot of things need to be done and therefore there 
needs to be much more issues than in the previous sprints. 

Sprint review: In this sprint we didn't achieve all the things we wanted to. There were several times we were scheduling
meetings, but no one took the initiative to start the call. The group  didn't have the best motivation and were
waiting to have the checkpoint instead of trying the best we could before the checkpoint. We managed to make some 
progress in the backend aspect of the project by redesigning the relationship diagram and implementing it in code, but 
there is still a lot to do. The frontend of the application is beginning to look similar to how we want it according to 
the wireframe. In terms of backend functionality added to the application we worked on this together on a single 
computer. The frontend parts were split into three. The group continued to work on the three different sites where every
member had responsibility for one each.

What went good?
The group were better at creating and using the issues for this sprint and therefore the tasks got clearer. We didn't 
face so many merge conflicts because of the better planning.

What went bad? / What can be improved?
The motivation wasn't good enough across the group and scheduled work sessions were dropped because no one took the 
initiative, this lead to slower progress then we aimed for. Meeting and working on scheduled sessions will be important
for the upcoming sprint.

## Sprint 5

25th april- 5 may
In this sprint we will implement frontend functionality that is a result of the data on the backend/server. The search 
form should be mapped to hotels that exist at the backend. Another thing we will work on in this sprint is to make the
design more responsive, but this will not be the main focus. We need to discuss what the admin functionality should be 
and try to implement different functionality based on what role you are assigned on the website. The concrete 
functionality will be described more in the issues for this sprint.

To achieve what we want we have decided to be more strict on the planned work schedules. We have decided to work on
tuesday, wednesday and friday on school for a longer session. More session will be scheduled as we see the need, but 
every member has to meet physically for these sessions. We will attempt to implement frontend functionality first on the
backend side before implementing it visually at the frontend.

Sprint review: Due to exams in other subject we didn't manage to complete our sprint goals in time. We decided to 
extend the sprint till our goals was reached before starting the next sprint before the final deadline. In this sprint
we all started to work on the backend. We were struggling to make a breakthrough tho. We used a lot of time figuring out
what to do. As more time was being used on the backend with little to no progress. Sander and Daniel decided to add a 
lot more content and design to the website to make it look more complete. Sten had some ideas on how to connect the 
front and backend ,so he was spending the time in trying to glue the components together. After our exam however we had 
more time to focus on the project. It was during the period between 8th may and the 15th we made the most of our 
progress especially from the 12th -15th. Sander made the first breakthrough at the backend with discovering an error. 
With a localhost connection we saw our data from the database in the JSON format. We created some Postman tests to 
ensure that data was being read correctly. The database now had a proper connection to the backend. Sten was the first 
one to fetch the data to the frontend by displaying the hotel name on one of our card components showing different
hotels with their respective reviews. 

What went good?
We managed to make the design more responsive. There is still some designing to do, but it improved a lot this sprint. 
Everyone attended the work session we planned together. 

What went bad? / What can be improved?
Something that can be improved upon is reviewing each other code and ideas. When we made the biggest progress was when 
we sat down and helped each other finding the errors. There were code bits that we just assumed were correct without 
reviewing it properly ,and therefore we didn't find the errors as early as we would have wanted. 

## Sprint 6

15th may - 22nd may
This will be the last sprint before the final hand in, a lot has to be done and this sprint needs to be planned 
thoroughly. The first part of the sprint will be to fulfill all the minimum requirements. The database sketch need to 
be reviewed one final time. The contents from the database will now be displayed at the frontend ,and therefore we need
to have the correct mapping. There is some design and features that we have had on our website for a long time, now that
there is backend communication we need to start with the required functionality first. Fun to have functionality can not 
be the main focus of this sprint going forward, this can be added the last days. A proper presentation for this project
is also something that needs to be done. We can not start on the presentation the day before.

To achieve what we want we will be using localhost connection to experiment with the database. There is a data 
initializer class that makes it easy to reload the data if we want to experiment on the localhost. The communication 
going forward needs to be good. We need to inform each other what we will be working on ,so we avoid heavy merge 
conflicts. There is some Postman tests for testing and a lot more of them needs to be added to secure that the 
application work as intended. A lot of issues will be made in our GitHub. 

Sprint review
We created a product that we are satisfied with. We can add a booking, we can add a hotel to favorites. An admin can 
hide hotel from other users. The site is very similar to what we planned on early in february. In the last part of the 
project every group member worked both on the frontend and the backend. Sander did a lot of Postman testing for the 
backend and filled the other member up on how it worked. Sander handled for the most part the log in functionality and 
the authorization. Sten managed to make methods for fetching the data to the frontend and handled the booking of the 
frontend. Daniel made backend functions for booking  as well as implementing the favorites to the backend functionality. 
Sander also participated for this and especially in the fetching to the frontend part. We made a lot of issues this s
print and members took issues and started to implement them into code and informed each other what they were working on. 
The sprint reports and the presentation are mostly made by Daniel the groups responsible for documentation. There has 
been some documentation in this project and the last day was mostly used by Daniel to secure that part. A lot of minor
designing technicalities were fixed by the members the last days.

What went good?
Every group member dedicated a lot of time and work into the last sprint of the project. The communication between each 
other was very good, and if a member was stuck on a problem we helped each other to solve the problems. The progress day
to day was very good, and we made many and defined issues. We also communicated with other groups and shared thoughts 
and idea and this helped the both of us of progressing towards the final result. We read the requirements and our goal 
was to check of at least one requirement each day, and we managed to do so. 

What went bad?
We picked up one of the mandatory requirements a bit too late in the project, so we needed to do a quick fix to match
the requirements. If we managed to pick up this at an earlier stage we would have developed a more complete solution. 
The solution we came up with is by now means bad and the rest of our work shows that we have learned a lot of skills.
