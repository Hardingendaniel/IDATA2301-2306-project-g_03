# Sprint

This file contains reviews of all the sprints conducted through the project. Sprints are based on 
sprints used in the Scrum process. The first sprints will in the start be planned towards the different
checkpoints that are planned by the lecturer. As the project progresses there will be more frequently sprints.
After the easter break it will be scheduled sprints that last one week and maximum 2.

## Sprint 1 / Checkpoint C 2

The plan for this sprint is to experiment with the new concepts we are learning in the web technology subject as well as
doing exercises for both the application development and web technology course. Our goal is that the project progression
will match the checkpoint pipeline given by the lecturer. This we will achieve by attending lectures and plan work 
sessions.

This sprint started in week 5 and ended in week 8. The main focus of this sprint was to establish the fundamentals in 
the project. We dedicated quite some time in designing the wireframe. We also made E/R diagram and a use case diagram. 
The first thing we did after the first checkpoint was to make a repository in GitHub. In the repository we created a 
html file where we coded the html skeleton for the project. We also worked a bit on the server side, but mainly just 
exercises to get to know how the server works. 

What went good?
The tasks for this sprint were well distributed. There was no problem in attendance when sessions were scheduled. Sander 
had the main responsibility of designing the wireframe and the diagrams, but Daniel and Sten played a role in this too. 
Sten made the HTML skeleton and coded a bit in CSS, HTML and javascript to resemble the wireframe we made. Daniel made 
the git repository and had main responsibility for the sprint report.  

What went bad?/ What can be improved? 
The start of this sprint started with the extreme weather Ingunn, the thursday lectures were canceled. In this week we
didn't really do anything that lead to progression. Moving forward if there is something that comes up we should 
consider to have online meetings. However, the majority of the sessions we prefer to be physical. In this sprint only 
Sander made issues in the GitHub repository. The other group members need to make issues as well, to better keep 
track of what needs to be done.

## Sprint 2 / Checkpoint 3
