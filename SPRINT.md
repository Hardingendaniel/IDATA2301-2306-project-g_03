# Sprint

This file contains reviews of all the sprints conducted through the project. Sprints are based on 
sprints used in the Scrum process. The first sprints will in the start be planned towards the different
checkpoints that are planned by the lecturer. As the project progresses there will be more frequently sprints.
After the easter break it will be scheduled sprints that last one week and maximum 2.

## Sprint 1 /Checkpoint C 2

The main focus of this sprint was to establish the fundamentals in the project. We dedicated quite some time in 
designing the wireframe. We also made E/R diagram and a use case diagram. The first thing we did after the first
checkpoint was to make a repository in GitHub. In the repository we created a html file where we coded the html 
skeleton for the project. We also worked a bit on the server side, but mainly just exercises to get to know how the 
server works. The tasks were distributed well within the group.

Moving forward towards the next checkpoint we will invest time into the exercises given by the lecturer and all the 
members should practice writing in html and css for getting an understanding of how elements are put together. We will
also need to experiment with javascript.
