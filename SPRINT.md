# Sprint

This file contains reviews of all the sprints conducted through the project. Sprints are based on 
sprints used in the Scrum process. The first sprints will in the start be planned towards the different
checkpoints that are planned by the lecturer. As the project progresses there will be more frequently sprints.
After the easter break it will be scheduled sprints that last one week and maximum 2.

## Sprint 1 / Checkpoint C 2

The plan for this sprint is to experiment with the new concepts we are learning in the web technology subject as well as
doing exercises for both the application development and web technology course. Our goal is that the project progression
will match the checkpoint pipeline given by the lecturer. This we will achieve by attending lectures and plan work 
sessions.

This sprint started in week 5 and ended in week 8. The main focus of this sprint was to establish the fundamentals in 
the project. We dedicated quite some time in designing the wireframe. We also made E/R diagram and a use case diagram. 
The first thing we did after the first checkpoint was to make a repository in GitHub. In the repository we created a 
html file where we coded the html skeleton for the project. We also worked a bit on the server side, but mainly just 
exercises to get to know how the server works. 

What went good?
The tasks for this sprint were well distributed. There was no problem in attendance when sessions were scheduled. Sander 
had the main responsibility of designing the wireframe and the diagrams, but Daniel and Sten played a role in this too. 
Sten made the HTML skeleton and coded a bit in CSS, HTML and javascript to resemble the wireframe we made. Daniel made 
the git repository and had main responsibility for the sprint report.  

What went bad?/ What can be improved? 
The start of this sprint started with the extreme weather Ingunn, the thursday lectures were canceled. In this week we
didn't really do anything that lead to progression. Moving forward if there is something that comes up we should 
consider to have online meetings. However, the majority of the sessions we prefer to be physical. In this sprint only 
Sander made issues in the GitHub repository. The other group members need to make issues as well, to better keep 
track of what needs to be done.

## Sprint 2 / Checkpoint 3

The plan for this sprint Week 8 - Week 12 :
The plan for this sprint is firstly to work according to the feedback given by the lecturers in checkpoint C2. Some 
adjustments in the wireframe, database sketch and the use case diagram (more detailed described in issues). In the end
of this sprint we want to have a closely finished wireframe for computer display. In addition to this we need to create 
sketches of responsive sites (sketches for mobile phones tablets etc). We will also work towards having a static site 
with design in place. We will focus on getting a more descriptive and more concise design.md file. It is important to
set aside time so that the design guidelines for the web is followed.

To achieve what we want for this upcoming sprint we will need to look at the previous sprint. We will continue with what
went good and adjust according to what didn't. To develop our web and application skills we will as a group work on the
weekly exercises in both subjects. A crucial part of learning is by doing. In this upcoming sprint there will be 
scheduled at least one physical work session per week.    

Sprint review:
The tasks for this sprint was completed. We managed to create a website which were pretty identical to the wireframe 
sketch, and we are satisfied with this sprint progress. We created three separate html files one for the main page, one
for the different hotel options and one with detailed information about one specific hotel. By doing so each member of 
the group could participate in the designing and get the necessary learning. A sketch for a mobile version was also 
created. We also did some improvements on the database sketch and the user diagram. However, this needs to be further  
improved before we do more on the backend part of the project. 

What went good?
In this sprint we made better use of the issues. We also distributed the task in a way that every member knew what they
were supposed to do. We split up so Daniel worked on the main page of the website, which Sten worked quite a bit on last
sprint. Sander worked on hotel offer site and sten worked on the hotel description site. We had weekly sessions were we
discussed the work going forward and informed each other about changes made. 

What went bad? / What can be improved?
There are a lot of similar elements on each of the three html sites and css files. So now the frontend folder has some 
duplicated code. This is a thing that needs to be improved up on. For the next sprint we need to define a css file that 
will contain the elements that are the same on all html files. The website looked weird on larger screens so this issue
we need to address. A max width and leave white space is a common practice on booking sites. That option should be 
considered.

## Sprint 3.5 

The plan for this sprint Week 12 - April 14
The plan for this sprint is to refactor the code a bit . The issue regarding code duplication is being addressed in 
this sprint. There is also some design choices on the hotel page that need so be decided on and implemented in code. 
We have decided to use React JS frontend and spring boot rest api. So in this sprint we need to focus on learning and 
testing out react. We also need to figure out how the design should be implemented on smaller and bigger screens. 
We need to focus more on the backend. Until now the focus have almost been 100% on the frontend, now we need to have
a more 50/50 focus on the two ends. For now, it is hard to know exactly what needs to be done at the backend, but this 
will come as descriptive issues in our GitHub repository as we work on it.

To achieve what we want for this upcoming sprint we will split up the tasks in well-defined issues. We will also have 
more weekly meetings. One of the meetings or study session should be on school. We should also consider having short
discord meetings where we can decide on the things we work on separately. Another way of achieving the sprint goals is
to take more use of our lecturers and asking questions in the lecture/lecture breaks.  

Sprint review:
In this sprint we faced som difficulties. The transformation to react was a bit more challenging than expected. It went
quite some time figuring out how we should do things. The application didn't work because of some react specific syntax
and that was hard to get hang on. We managed to transform our project to a React project in the end. We didn't add new
functionality to the existing project we just made it look how it was before the transformation. Also some lack of 
communication lead to som unnecessary difficulties. 

What went good? 
In this sprint each group member dedicated more time to work on the project. We met and worked on our project several 
times. We managed to solve the problems we were faced and didn't lose motivation because of the difficulties. The first
transformation of the project were mostly done by Sten and Daniel, the reuse of footer and header. When the 
transformation first started we hadn't learned about routing and that was later worked quite bit on by Sander. On the 
end of the sprint Sander also implemented the tailwind css for the styling of the pages. This will be used for the final
project.

What went bad / What can be improved?
In this sprint there were a lot of choices to be made. The communication between the group members wasn't always the 
best. We faced some merge conflicts that could have easily been avoided with better communication. We also didn't do
much at the backend side of the application, which was planned in the sprint. The group tend to go silent when we don't 
know what to do. We need to communicate and share our thoughts with each other when we hit a speed bump in the work 
flow. Daniel dedicated quite some time in the documentation part of the project with issues and such. In the upcoming 
work other members needs to be more involved.

## Sprint 4

The plan for this sprint april 16th-25th
This wil be the last sprint meeting with the lecturers. Each group member have a responsibility to dedicate a lot of 
time to work on the project. Every other day we will work together on the project, and we will fill each other in on 
what we have done individually. The issues regarding styling the hotel-page and making decisions for different screens 
is still relevant since it wasn't completed in the last sprint. We need to establish a communication between the front 
and the backend. Images and text descriptions should be loaded from the backend and not hard coded in the jsx files.

To achieve what we want for this upcoming sprint it is important that every group member starts to use the issues 
properly. It is easier to keep track of what needs to be done if issues are made along the way. It is important
that we remind each other to create these issues. In this sprint a lot of things need to be done and therefore there 
needs to be much more issues than in the previous sprints.
